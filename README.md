# Module_3_challenge

# Overview
The purpose of this code was to find out which county has the largest count of votes with other factors
such as read, write and store data from files/arrays and decision statements with logical operations
for precise results. The goal was to extract results from individual candidates, counties and winning results.

# Data Results
* There were a total of 369,711 Votes
* County Votes:
  * Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855) 
  * Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
  * Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
* The Candidates & their results (Vote percentage, Vote count):
  * Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
  * Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
  * Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
* Winning results
  * Winner: Denver
  * Winning Vote Count: 306,055

# Audit Summary
This project can be very flexible when working with other similiar sets of data regarding an election system
that requires to track total vote count/vote percentage for counties and individual candidates, largest county turnout
and the winning results. Overall it is very consistent and reliable when dealing with state elections due to the smaller sets of data. Although for national elections, it may need some tweaking when dealing with larger sets of data.
